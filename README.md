### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

  I'm Filipe BrandÃ£o, a software engineer born and raised in Portugal ğŸ‡µğŸ‡¹

  I'm currently working as a remote Lead Android Developer at GrocerKey, improving the shopping experience in North America and making the remote-first paradigm shift a reality.

  I'm interested in challenging today's work boundaries by making the remote-first paradigm shift a reality.
