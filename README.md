### Hi there 👋

  I'm Filipe Brandão, a software engineer born and raised in Portugal 🇵🇹

  I'm currently working as a remote Android Developer at Busbud - developing software that users love, enabling them to have a delightful experience when traveling in a sustainable way.

  I'm interested in challenging today's work boundaries by making the remote-first paradigm shift a reality. I'm also curious for the present and future of AI, I'm currently re-shaping the way I work and how I see software engineering through this new "AI lense". 

The key strengths that I possess include:

    🌍 I have successfully designed, developed, and maintained Android apps deployed all around the globe.
    📈 I strive for continued excellence and improvement, I care a lot about both internal and external software quality. I also make sure my code is SOLID and I'm passionate about software architecture.
    🤖 I have experience with Android development for 10+ years (since Android 2) which gives me a deep understanding of the platform itself and the full lifecycle of a software development project (be it in a Agile or more traditional approach).
    💯 Throughout my career I participated in smaller projects doing backend and frontend development which provides me a more holistic view over software.
    👬 I have worn many hats, also in non-technical ways, from mentoring coworkers to being assigned roles of leadership, which allowed me to code-centric tasks and build a larger set of skills.
